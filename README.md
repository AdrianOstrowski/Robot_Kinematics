# Robot_Kinematics

The purpose of the project was adopted to develop an application, using the C++ programming language, whose task is to simulate the movement of a six-axis robot and visualize the movement of a TCP point. The robot has a kinematic structure {CR, BR1, BR2, BL, CL, AL}.
Additional objectives to be realized were: 
-the ability of the user to enter the values of the geometric parameters of the regional and local parts of the robot, 
-setting the approach vector of the members of the local part of the robot
-selecting the coordinates of the start and end points of the movement.
The visualization was also to be divided into equidistant points, allowing the user to observe the subsequent stages of the displacement simulation.
